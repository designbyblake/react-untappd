# React Untappd 

I'm just playing around learning React and using the Untappd API to do it. At the moment this app simply allows you to enter a username and see the most recent check-ins.

On the off chance you want to use this code (I wouldn't recommend it), change untappd.js.txt to untappd.js and add your Untappd API Client Id and Secret.
